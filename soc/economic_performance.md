# Measurement of Economic Performance

> **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** (*market values*, *resident production units*, *specific period of time*, *engage or intend in economic activities*), *calculation of GDP* (*no products produced in other periods*, *transactions not involving production not counted*. *items not counted statistically excluded*, *items causing the problem of double counting excluded*), **GDP growth rate**, **per capita GDP**, **Gross National Income (GNI)** (*total incomes*, *residents of an economy*, *regardless of whether in or out of the territory*, *engage or intend in economic activities*), **GNI growth rate**, **per capita GNI**, **economic performance of an economy**, **standards of living of an economy**, **facilitate international comparison**, **making production and investment plans**, **formulating economic policies**, **Human Development Index** (*life expectancy*, *expecting years of schooling*, **)

## Gross Domestic Product and Gross National Income (GDP and GNI)

### Gross Domestic Product

> **Gross Domestic Product** is the *total market values of goods and services produced by all resident producing units of an economy in a specific period*
>
> **Resident producing units** of an economy can be individuals or organizations that *engaged in or intended to engage in economic activities* in the economy in the period of time

- Examples of resident producing units: local bakery, local train service provider etc.

- Not ALL transactions and activities are included in GDP:
  1. *Items not produced in the specific period*: *past inventories* -> unsold products which are not produced in the specific period; even if transacted in the period, the values are not included in GDP or it results in *double counting*
  2. *Transactions not involving production*: *transfer payments* are government subvention provided to individuals and organizations; excluded as the recipents do not produce any goods or services to the government in return
  3. *Items not counted statistically*: the values of *unpaid goods or services* produced by households for self-consumption are excluded in the calculation of GDP
  4. *Items causing the problem of double counting*: the values of *second-hand goods* produced by an economy has been counted in GDP when they are first produced and should not be counted in the calculation again to avoid *double counting*

### Gross National Income (GNI)

> **Gross National Income** is the *total income earned by all residents of an economy* from *engaging in various economic activities regardless whether such activities are carried out within or outside the territory of the economy*
>
> **Residents of an economy** includes *individuals who have stayed or intended to stay in an economy for at least one year or organizations who ordinarily operate in the economy*

- Note that per capita GNI can reflect the *average value of final output per person*

### Uses of GDP and GNI

1. **To assess the economic performance of an economy**

2. **To assess the living standard of an economy**

3. **To facilitate international comparison**

4. **To help firms in making production and investment plans**

5. **To help the government in formulating economic policies**

## Economic Growth and Development

> **Economic growth** refers to the *increase in output* measured in terms of *GDP (per capita) over time*
>
> **Economic development** refers to the process that *leads to improved standards of living for the population as a whole*

- Note that economic development is a multi-dimensional, both quantitative and qualitative concepts that requires different kinds of measures to assess

### Human Development Index (HDI)

- **Human development index**: a composite index to measure an economic's development in terms of:
  1. *Health*: **life expectancy**
  2. *Education level*: **expected years of schooling**
  3. *Living standard*: **per capita GNI**

- The HDI is an index between 0 and 1, and *higher the HDI, the better is the economic development*

- Limitation: does not measures other aspects, e.g., gender equality, income equality etc.

## Unemployment

- **Labour force** (of an economy): the total # of people in *working age* who are *willing, able and ready to work*, for pay or profit (labour or entrepreneurship::) (Hong Kong working age: over 15)

- *Labour force* are the *economically active population*

- Labour force = *employed population + unemployed population*

### Employed and Unemployed Population

> **Employed population** refers to the *persons who perform work for pay or profit or have a formal job attachment*
>
> **Unemployed population** refers to the *persons who are willing to and able to work but failed to find a job*, i.e., *they do not have a job and are available for and seeking work*

**Unemployment rate**: *proportion of unemployed population in the labour force*

### Costs of Unemployment

To the unemployed:

  1. **Lower living standard**: loss of income -> have to cut expenditures for goods and services
  2. **Loss of productivity**: skills and experiences lost or become outdated with time -> increasing difficulty to be employed in the future
  3. **Suffers from psychological problems**: great frustration and lowered self-esteem due to financial pressure

To the society:

  1. **Loss of human capital**: human resources not fully utilized -> hinders the economic growth of the economy
  2. **Social and political unrest**: discontent and political unrest; higher crime rates

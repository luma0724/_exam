## Poverty

- Two types of poverty: **absolute poverty** and **relative poverty**

### Absolute Poverty

- Definition: *lacking the means to support human basic needs*, i.e., food, water, shelter etc.

- Measure: **absolute poverty line**:: a measureable amount of money converted from the expenditures on satisfying the human basic needs of individuals or households

- United Nations: **global extreme poverty line**::*living on less than USD $1.90 every day per person*

- World Bank: the *extreme poverty line* varies from country to country

### Relative Poverty

- Definition: *in comparison to most people standing in the economy, people in relative poverty cannot afford activley to participate in the society and benefit from the experiences which most people take as granted*

- The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD): *income ratio* taking *the median social income* of a country or region as the *relative poverty line*

- World Bank: *1/3 of the average social income* as the *relative poverty line*

### Multidimensional Poverty

- Poverty *entails more than the lack of income to support daily necessities, but one's both physical and mental well-being*

- *Non-monetary measures* for **multidimensional poverty**: multidimensional comprehensive index that comprise nutrition, housing, education, medical oppurtunities, mental health etc.

## Poverty Alleviation

- Theory: *absolute poverty can be eradicated* (not relative poverty)

### Global Poverty Situation

- Extreme poverty: *10% of the world's population live under extreme poverty*; *20% of the children live under extreme poverty*

- UNSDG: **end poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030**

- *Decline of population in extreme poverty as a result of poverty reduction in China and India*

- Shift in extreme poverty to Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa due to the COVID-19 pandemic

### China's Poverty Eradication

#### Success of China's Anti-Poverty Campaign

- Feb 2021: President Xi announced that *China has successed in eradicating extreme poverty everywhere in her territory*

- Example: 770 million impoverished rural residents living under the extreme poverty line since the beginning of reform and opening-up were lifted out of poverty; all impoverished counties removed from the poverty list; tailored medical treatments offered to 20 million impoverished rural residdents; all of them received social protection; the number of drop-out reduced to zero; renovated millions of kilometers of rural roads; power supply and internet-access coverage expanded to almost 100%; millions of people relocated to where with better natural conditions; China met the poverty eradication goal set in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Develoopment 10 years ahead of schedule, according to the World Bank's international poverty line, China contributes to 70% of the total of number of people lifted out of poverty

#### Reasons for China's Success in Poverty Eradication

- *Poverty eradication through strong economic development brought about by reform and opening-up policies (marketization, urbanization, modernisation)*:
  - Examples: Household Responsibility System, Township and Village Enterprises, state-owned enterprise reform, Coastal Development Plan (economic clusters, special economic zones etc.), Entry into WTO
  - Elaboration: *increased job oppurtunities*, *improved standard of living* etc.

- *Effectivenesss of rural poverty reduction*:
  - Examples: enhancement of rural infrastrucutres, modernization of agriculture technology, support development of industry in rural area, efforts in ecological conservation, hukou reform etc.

- *Improved social protection system*:
  - Examples: social issurance, assitance and welfares::*Dibao (Subsistence Allowance System)*, *Medical Assistance in Rural Area*, *Five Gurantees System in Rural Area*, *New Rural Pension Scheme*, *Sunshine Project*, *Free Compulsory Primary and Middle-School Education*, *Dewdrop Project*
  - Elaboration: to increase people's income by public transfer, increase people resilience to impoverishment by enhancing their *self-development capabilities and competiveness* in labour markets, with social protection system to help them obtain employment oppurtunities and stable income

- *Strong governance: President Xi's strategy of* **targeted poverty alleviation**:
  1. Identify people in need to know *whom to help*: standard and procedures in identification with consideration such as household income, housing, education level etc.
  2. Strengthen leadership and team-building to know *how to offer help*: centralized and unified leadership with strict supervision and accountabiility system and sufficient financial support from the central authority
  3. Applying targeted measures to different groups of people to know *how to help*: e.g., boosting the local economy to provide more job oppurtunities, relocating residents from inhospitable areas, compensating for economic losses, improving education in impoverished areas, providing subsistence allowances for those unable to shake off poverty through their own hands
  4. Adopt strict criteria to know *when and how to deregister for those who have emerged from poverty*: clear established poverty exit mechanism
  5. Conducting following-up monitoring to *help people staying out of poverty*: dynamic management

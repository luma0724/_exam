# Introduction to Globalization

> **Globalization** (*compression of time and space*, *diminishing time & space constraints*, *interconnectedness & interdependency*, *increase world trade*) (**cultural globalization** (*world economy*) & **economic globalization** (*homogenization & heterogeneity*)), **multinational cooperations (MNCs)** (*departmentalization & localization & standardization*), **factors of globalization** (*transport network*, *promotion of free trade*, *influence of MNCs*, *information technology*)
> (*Resources and Economoic Activities::*, *World Trade::*, *International interdependence*)

## Definition

> In general, **globalization** is the **compression of time and space** (*interdependency & interconnectedness*).

- Characteristics:
  - *Diminishing contract of time and space*, and as a result:
  - Increasing *participation in world trade, economy, politics, socio-cutural activities*, and as a result:
  - (International interdependence::) Increasing *interconnectedness/ interdependency* among countries around the world

## Nature of Globalization

- Two nature of globalization: **economic globalization** & **cultural globalization**

### Economic Globalization

- Characteristics:
  - (International interdependence::) Increasing *interconnectedness of the world economy*
  - (World trade::) Growing scale of *cross-border trade*
  - (Resources and economic activities::) Increasing *flow of capital, labour, technology* around the world

- Concerns about: *connectedness* -> problems with both developed countries & undeveloped countries?

### Cultural Globalization

- Characteristics: (Culture::) worldwide *cultural standardization (homogenization)* & *cultural pluralism (hetrogeneity)*

- Concerns about: *homogenization & hetrogeneity* -> impact on local culture and identity?

## Agents of Globalization

- *Multinational corporations (MNCs)*:
  - Characteristics: coordinate global management & production
  - Examples: e.g., Nike, Toshiba, Huawei, Haier etc.
  - Strategies: *standardization of products* for massive production; *departmentalization* in sourcing, production and marketing; *localization* to accommodate to local culture;

- *International organizations*

## Factors of Globalization

1. **Advancement of communication technology**:
   - Examples: e.g., instant messaging, internet, emails etc.
   - Explanation: *eliminate geographical barriers* & *foster the flow of information* -> *reduced time and cost in transporting for communication*

2. **Expansion of transport network**:
   - Examples: e.g., *One belt one road*, development of a global transport network linking landlocked countries together; increase the passenger & cargo capacity
   - Explanation: *reduce travelling time and cost, i.e., shrinks space and compress time* -> (World trade:: & economic activities) encourages *cross-border trades* & *tourism*; (as a result) cultural & economic globalization

3. **Promotion of free trade**:
   - Examples: e.g., opening up of markets; *reducing trade barriers* e.g., quotas, tariffs
   - Explanation: (Economic activities:: & world trade::) with reduced trade barriers, i.e., lower cost; oversea business and free trade promoted

4. **Increasing influence of MNCs**:
   - Examples: e.g., *localization & departmentalization*
   - Explanation: (Economic activities::) faciliate trade & *intergrate commodity & financial & labour markets* into a global one

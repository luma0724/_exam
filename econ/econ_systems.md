# Types of Economic Systems

> **Traditional economy** (*customs & traditions*, *primitive society & production method*), **planned economy/ command economy** (*public ownership of productive resources*, *limited freedom of contract*, *centralized decision making*, *government decisions*, *easily accomplised government objectives*, *better addressed social services*), **market economy/ market-oriented economy/ capitalist economy** (*private ownership of productive resources,*freedom of contract*,*private property right*,*decentralized decision making*,*market mechanism*,*demand & supply*,*price as distributive medium*,*price competition*,*pursuit of self-interest*,*saving production costs*,*misdirection of resource allocation*,*unfair business practices*,*lack of income safety net*), **mix economy**, **specialization & exchange**

## Traditional Economy

### Features of Traditional Economy

- Society in: usually *relatively primitive*

- Nature: rigid social structure and slow inovation -> *primitive methods of production*

### Traditional Economy: Addressing the Basic Economic Problems

- Solution: *long-established* **customs and traditions**

## Planned Economy (a.k.a. Command Economy)

### Features of Planned Economy

- Ownership of properties: **public ownership** of *most productive resources*::e.g., state-owned land, machines, natural resources (mean of production::)etc.
  - private ownership deprecated (ownership::)
  - most *consumer goods* can be owned privately (producer & consumer goods::)

- Exchange: *restrictions on* **freedom of contract**:
  - *little freedom* in drawing up *agreements* and choosing *occupations*

- Decision-making: **centralized**
  - decisions: *most* decisions made by the central authority - the government
  - government system: *bureaucracy* with many levels of control and supervision
  - price: *government-controlled prices*, i.e., ~demand & supply (demand & supply::)
  - nature: planned production, i.e., lack of *market competition*

### Planned Economy: Addressing the Basic Economic Problems

- Solution: determined by *the state*

### Planned Economy::Merits

- *Government objectives* can be more easily reached by *direct administration and centralised planning*

- Essential *social services* can be more easily addressed if well administered

### Planned Economy::Demerits

- Demand & supply: lack of *market mechanism* -> *consumers' preferences* unlikely to be addressed => mismatch between demand & supply

- Production method: lack of *price competition* -> lack of *incentive to save production costs and innovate* => lower factors of production

- Government system: bureaucracy -> *inefficient use of resources*

- Consequences to sum up: tend to lead to *slower growth of economy*; *lower standard of living*

## Market Economy (a.k.a Market-oriented Economy/ Capitalist Economy)

### Features of Market Economy

- Ownership of properties: **private ownership** of *most productive resources*, i.e., most productive resources owned by *private individuals or firms*:
  - **private property rights** protected by law:

> The **private property rights** refer to owners' three sets of rights:
>
> 1. *the exclusive right to use the property*
>
> 2. *the exclusive right to receive income from the property* (factor income of capitals::)
>
> 3. *the right to transfer a property*

- Exchange: **freedom of contracts**:
  - freedom in drawing agreements on the buying and selling of properties and assets
  - freedom in choosing occupations in which they are qualified
  - freedom in production and consumption (production & consumption::)

- Decision-making: **decentralized**:
  - decisions: *individuals* make their decisions in order to *maximize their goals*
  - **market mechanism**: prices of most goods determined by *demand & supply* (demand & supply::)
  - competitive criteria: *price competition*, i.e., price as the *major distributive device*

### Market Economy: Addressing the Basic Economic Problems

- Determined by the *market mechanism*

### Market Economy::Merits

- *Consumers' preferences* addressed by production patterns of firms

- The *pursuit of self-interest* create incentives that promote *economic growth*, e.g., *private property rights* & *competition*

### Market Economy::Demerits

- May *misdirect allocation of resources* without overall planning

- Only *demand & supply* -> *insufficient social safety net* provided to low-income group

- *Threats of unfair business practices* from big enterprises

## Mixed Economy

- *Co-existence* of elements of *traditional, planned and market economies*

## Specialization & Exchange

### Specialization

- Production technique:: & resource allocation::

- *Different people or economy concentrates on producing different goods and services*

### Exchange

- Resoruce allocation::

- Exchange -> no need to produce everything one need

- Exchange <-> Specialization

# Demand and Supply

> *planned quantites & individuals v.s. all & willing to and able to & different prices/ particular price/ a period of time*, *horizontal summation*, **Individual demand**, **quantity demanded** (*demand schedule, individual/ market demand curve*), **market demand**, **law of demand** (*price negative relationship with quantity demanded*); **individual supply**, **quantity supplied** (*supply schedule, individual/ market supply curve*), **market supply**, **law of supply** (*price positively relationship with quantity supplied*), **equilibrium price**, **quantity equilibrium**, **market equilibrium**, **shortage**, **surplus**

## Demand and Quantity Demanded

> An **individual demand** for a good refers to the *planned quantities* that a consumer is *willing to and able to buy at different prices over a period of time*, **ceteris paribus**

- Note that a demand does not equal a want as it has to be backed up by *purchasing power*

> The **quantity demanded** of an individual for a good refers to the *planned quantities* that a consumer is *willing to and able to buy at a particular price over a period of time*

- Note that a demand does not equal a quantity demanded; demand -> mapping between prices and qiuantity demanded over a period of time; quantity -> instant quantities at a particular price; represented by a *demand schedule/ curve v.s. numerical quantities*

### Demand Schedule

- **Demand schedule**: a table showing the *relationship between price & quantity demanded*

### Individual Demand Curve

- **Demand curve**: y-axis: price (P), x-axis: quantity demanded (Q), line labeled (D)::*downward-sloping*

### law of Demand

> The **law of demand** states that, when *the price of a good increases*, *the quantity demanded will decrease*, vice versa, ceteris paribus

### Market Demand

> **Market demand** refers to the *planned quantites* that *all individual purchasers* are *willing to and able to buy at different prices over a period of time*, ceteris paribus

- *Horizontal summation of individual demand curves* -> market demand curve

## Supply and Quantity Supplied

> An **individual supply** of a good refers to the *planned quantities* that a producer is *willing and able to produce at different prices over a period of time*, ceteris paribus
>
> The **quantity supplied** of an individual for a good refers to the *planned quantities* a producer is *willing and able to produce at a particular price over a period of time*

### Supply Schedule

- **Supply schedule**: a table showing the *relationship between price & quantity supplied*

### Individual Supply Curve

- **Individual supply curve** -> *upward-sloping*

### Law of Supply

> The **law of supply** states that, when *the price of a good increases*, *the quantity supplied will increase*, vice versa, ceteris paribus

### Market Supply

> **Market supply** of a good refers to the *planned quantities* that *all individual producers are willing and able to produce at different prices over a period of time*, ceteris paribus

### Market Supply Curve

- *Horizontal summation of individual supply curves* -> **market supply curve**

## Determinatioin of Equilibrium Price

### Equilibrium Price

> **Equilibrium price** of a good is the price at which *quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied* that there is *no tendency for the price to change*; the **equilibrium quantities** is the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied at equilibrium price

### Market Equilibrium & Disequilibrium

> **Market equilibrium** describes when the market price of a good is set at the *equilibrium price*, where *the quantity demanded equals quantity supplied*; no tendency to change
>
> **Shortage** describes when the market price of a good is set *below the equilibrium price*, that *the quantity demanded is larger than quantity supplied*; tendency for *price to increase* up till equilibrium price
>
> **Surplus** describes when the market price is set *above the equilibrium price*, that *the quantity supplied is larger than quantity demanded*; tendency for *price to decrease* until equilibrium price

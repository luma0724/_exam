  2. *Proportion of population that works*
  3. *Number of working hours*

### Average Labour Productivity

> **Average labour productivity** is the *output per unit of labour input*, i.e., *outputs per man-hour*.

- Average labour productivity = total quantities of output / total number of working hours

- Measurement: *units/man-hours*

- Factors:
  1. *Education and training on workers*: better equipped/ skills
  2. *Quantity/ quality of other factors of production*: better equipped
  3. *Management efficiency*: well-organized/ division of labour

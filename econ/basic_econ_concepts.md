# Basic Economic Concepts

> **Economics** (*resource allocation*), **resources & wants** (*natural resources, man-made resources, human resources*), **scarcity**, **cost** (**oppurtunity cost & time cost**), **economic & free goods** (*sufficiency*, *preference*, *production cost*, *free of charge*), **three basic economic problems** (*what, how, for whom*), **competition** (*price competition & non-price competition*)

## What is Economics?

> **Economics** is a study of how *limited resources* are *allocated* to *satisfy unlimited wants*.

- e.g., Humans' wants, e.g., for cars, flats, TV etc., are unlimited, but resources required to satisfy these wants are limited.

### Wants

> - **Wants** are *all kinds of human desires*. They need bot be backer up by *puchasing power*.

- Nature: human wants are **unlimited**, i.e., when we satisfy some wants, we develop others.

### Resources

> - **Resources** are what required to *produce goods or services* to *satisfy out wants*.

- Types of resources:
  1. **Natural resources**: e.g., land, air, ocean etc.
  2. **Human resources**: e.g., labour
  3. **Man-made resources**: e.g., machines, equipment etc.

- Nature: *the quantities of resources are limited relative to unlimited human wants*

### Scarcity

> **Scarcity** refers to a situation where *the quantity of resources is insufficient to satisfy unlimited huamn wants*.

- A resource is *scarce* when *the quantity available is insufficient to satisfy the human wants for it*.

- Nature: *universal problem*; cannot be solved as long as the quantity of resources is limited that it is insufficientto satisfy unlimited human wants

- Result of scarcity: *make choices* in resource allocation

## Opportunity Cost

> **Opportunity cost** is the *value of the highest-valued option forgone*.

- *Cost* -> (map) oppurtunity cost

- Make choices: lowest opportunity cost, i.e., choose the highest-valued option

- Change in oppurtunity cost:
  - Oppurtunity cost *remains unchanged* when there is *a change in the value of the chosen option*
  - Oppurtunity cost *only changes* when *the value of the highest-valued option forgone changes*
  - Oppurtunity cost *may or may not change* when there is *a change in the value of other options forgone*

## Time Cost

> **Time cost** is the *value of the highest-valued alternative use of time*.

## Types of Goods

> A **good** is a *anything that can satisfy human wants*.

- Examples: e.g., bread, subshine, oxygen etc.

- Types of goods: **economic goods & free goods**

### Economic Goods (Scarce Goods)

> An **economic good** is a *good* that *its quantity available is insufficient to satisfy all our wants*, i.e., *more of it is prefered*. There is an **oppurtunity cost** involved in *producing it*.

- Examples: e.g., paper, mobile phones, TV programs etc.

- Explanation: *scarce resources* required in production -> involves an *oppurtunity cost in production*; *more of it is preferred* -> people is willing to pay a price to buy it

- Note a good is an *economic good* if *scarce resources are requried in producing it*, even if it is *free of charge*

### Free Goods

> A **free good** is a *good* that *its quantity available is sufficient to satisfy all our wants*, i.e., *more of it is not prefered*

- Examples: e..g, air, sunlight etc.

- Explanation: *more of it is not preferred* -> no one is willing to pay a price for it

- Note that is a good is a *free good*, it is *free of charge*

## Three Basic Economic Problems

1. **What to produce?**::making choices about the *kind of goods* to product and the *quantity* to be produced (demand & supply::)

2. **How to produce?**::making choices about the *method of production*, i.e., how and what kinds of resources are to be combined in production to save cost (factors of production::, production techniques::)

3. **For whom to produce?**::making choices about who can obtain the goods or services according to some *criteria* (allocation of resources::)

### Competitive Criteria

1. **Price competition**::only one who is *willing and able to pay the market price* can obtain the limited resources

2. **Non-price competition**::use of *criteria other price* to allocate resources, e.g., first-come-first-served, academic results, random draw etc.

## Problems

1. Oppurtunity cost::watch movie::ranked choices: 1. *Minions*, 2. *Incredibles*, 3. *Avengers*; Ken's oppurtunity cost of watching *Minions*? watching *Incredibles* is the highest-valued option forgone. The oppurtunity cost is the value of watching *Incredibles*; True that Ken's oppurunity cost of watching *Minions* is the value of watching *Minions & Avengers*? false, Ken could not watch *Minions & Avengers* at the same time; hence, only watching another movie is forgone choosing to watch *Minions*; *Minions* is boring -> change in oppurtunity cost? the oppurtunity cost remains unchanged as there is no change in the value of the highest-valued option forgone despite the decrease in value of watching *Minions*, the option chosen; *Incredibles* nominated for the World's Best Picture -> change in oppurtunity cost? the oppurtunity cost increases as the value of watching *Incredible* the highest-valued option forgone increases; free gift can be redeemed with an Avengers movie ticket -> change in oppurtunity cost? it depends; if the value of watching *Avengers* increases to be higher than that of watching *Incredible* the highest-valued option forgone, then there is an increase in oppurtunity cost as the value of watching *Avengers* becomes the oppurtunity cost; if the value of watching *Avengers* does not become higher than that of watching *Incredible*, then the oppurtunity cost remains unchanged

2. Time cost::Kenny and Sally each bought a memorial banknote from a bank in Hong Kong and had to queue up for 10 hours for the purchase -> Kenny's oppurtunity cost same as Sally's definitely true? false, their time costs, the value of the highest-valued alternative use of time, may not be the same, i.e., different oppurtunity costs

3. Economic & free goods::Free goods are free of charge true? true; a free good is a good that its quantity available is sufficient to satisfy all our wants, i.e., more of it is not preferred -> no one will pay for it and hence it is free

4. Economic & free goods::Goods that are free are free og charge true? false; goods that are free may be economic goods, that its quantity available is insufficient to satisfy all our wants, i.e., more of it is prefered, or there is an opportunity cost in producing it, but it is not allocated by price competition but according to some other criterias

5. Scarcity and choice::following about choice is incorrect? A. people have to choose in order to avoid competition

6. Oppurtunity cost::not an oppurtunity cost of constructing Disneyland in Hong Kong? D. the entrance fee of Disneyland

7. Oppurtunity cost::john invites jason to play tennis in the afternoon -> jason not have oppurtunity cost if? D. None of the above options are true

8. Oppurtunity cost::2 options as how to spend the afternoon: either go to a concert or go to a karaoke lounge with his friends; whether oppurtunity cost of going to the karoke lounge would change if a. the concert was very boring? yes, the oppurtunity cost decreases because the value of going to a concert the highest-valued option forgone decreases as the concert was very boring; b. the service of the karaoke lounge was very poor? no, the oppurtunity cost remains unchanged as the value of going to the concert the highest-valued option forgone remains unchanged

9. Economic goods::which not classified as 'economic good'? C. stray and homeless dogs in the streets

10. Economic & free goods::Africa insufficient food; people dig into the ground for rats to eat, rats in the above case is? B. an economic good because more of it is preferred

11. Economic & free goods::charity rice are economic goods? D. people want more of this rice

12. Economic & free goods::explain when ice is a free good or an economic good? to the society, ice is a free good because more of it is preferred, and it is a natural resource, i.e., no oppurtunity cost in producing it; to the individual, ice is an economcic good because there is an oppurtunity cost in producing it, i.e., scarce resources e.g. electricity, fridge, are required to produce it

13. Job vacancies publications free of charge -> free goods to the society? no, there is an oppurtunity cost in producing it, i.e., scarce resources e.g., papers, printers, ink are required to produce it

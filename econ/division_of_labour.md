# Division of Labour

> **Division of labour** (*human resources concentrating at a particular*), **simple division of labour** (*one to a particular good*), **complex division of labour** (*one to a particular stage*), **regional division of labour** (*country/ region to a particular*), **raise average labour productivity** (*practice makes perfect*, *choose the most suitable workers*, *stimulus to mechanization*, *economy of time*), **economy of capital goods**, **raising living standard**, **monotomy of jobs**, **loss of craftmanship**, **over-interdependence**, **threat of unemployment**, **over-standardization**

(production::)
> **Division of labour** occurs when a *human resource concentrates on the production of a particular good/ production stage of a good*

## Types of Division of Labour

- Three types of division of labour (nature::): **simple & complex & regional division of labours**

### Simple Division of Labour

(particular good::)
> **Simple division of labour** occurs when a worker *specializes in producing a particular good or services*

- Examples: e.g., farmer specializing in farming

### Complex Division of Labour

(particular stage::)
> **Complex division of labour** occurs when a worker *specializes in one stage of a production process*

- Examples: e.g., different teachers coorperate to hold a school

### Regional Division of Labour

> **Regional division of labour** occurs when *a country or a region specializes in producing a particular good or service*

- Examples: Japan in cars, Malaysia in rubber plantation

### Advantages of Division of Labour

1. **Raise average labour productivity**:: *more goods can be produced with the same quantity of labour/ the same quantity of goods can be produced with less labour*:
   - **Choose the most suitable workers**: assign jobs to workers according to their talents for best use of talents
   - **Practice makes perfect**: encourgae repetition and continuous practice to be more skillful
   - **Stimulus to mechanization**: simples tasks allow use of machines
   - **Economy of time**: save time to adapt to new tasks and training

2. **Economy of capital goods**: only need the tools required for individual production stage

3. **Raising living standard**: higher average labour productvity and mass production lead to more goods produced

### Disadvantages of Division of Labour

1. **Monotomy of work**: repetition of work decreases working incentives

2. **Risk of unemployment**: when a particular industry falls, highly-specialized workers can find no jobs

3. **Over-interdependence among production stages**: if one production stage falls, the whole production process breaks

4. **Laws of craftmanship**: workers not aquiring all the skills necessary leads to loss of craftmanship

5. **Over-standardization of products**: consumers provided with only limited choices

### Limitations of Division of Labour

1. **Nature of products**: complex division of labours are only for products that could be standardized; otherwise resulting in a loss of personality and uniqueness

2. **Size of market**: smaller the market -> lower the degree of division of labour

3. **Possibilities of trade**: trade barriers or traffis may discourage regional division of labour

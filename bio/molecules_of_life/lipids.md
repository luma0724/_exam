# Lipids

> **Organic substances**, **H:O & C:O**, *insoluble in water & soluble in organic solvents*, **triglycerides** (*glycerol*, *fatty acid*, *condensation & hydrolysis*), **energy reserves** (*adipose tissue*), **heat insulator** (*subcutaneous fat*), **shock-absorber** (*organs*), **transportation** (*vitamins*), **phospholipid** (*cell membrane*), **cholestrol** (*lipid hormones*, *cell membrane*)

- **Organic substances**

- Constitution: *carbon ($C$)*, *hydrogen ($H$)*, *oxygen ($O$)*; **$H:O ~ 18:1$, $C:O ~ 10:1$** -> release more energy than carbohydrates

- Properties: *insoluble in water* but **soluble in organic solvents**, e.g., ethanol, ether, chloroform etc.

- Appearance (room temperature): semi-solid form: *fats*; liquid form: *oil*

- Examples: e.g., wax, steroids, **triglycerides**, **phospholipids**, **cholestral** etc.

## Triglycerides (Fats and oils)

- Structure: formed by the **condensation of one glycerol molecule and three fatty acid molecules**, with the removal of three water molecules

- Hydrolysis: splitted into a glycerol molecule and three fatty acid molecules (ester linkage) with the *addition of three water molecules*

- Condensation & hydrolysis -> reversible

- Note that the fatty acids may not be of the same type, e.g., palmitic, stearic, oleic etc.

- Functions: **energy reserves** (e.g., stored in *adipose tissues*); **insulator to heat loss** (e.g., *subcutaneous fat*); **shock-absorbers** (e.g., adipose tissues surround organs to protect them from damage); **transportation of lipid-soluble vitamins** (e.g., A, D, E, K)

## Phospholipids

- Structure: formed by one glycerol molecule and two fatty acid molecules with the other replaced by a **phosphate group**

- Functions: **major component of the cell membrane**

## Cholesterol

- Structure: complex molecules consisting of carbon rings

- Functions: major component of the cell membrane; required for synthesis of vitamin D, lipid hormones etc.

1. Lipids::| Biomolecules | Functions                      | Example(s)     |
|--------------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| Lipid        | Energy storage                 | Adipose tissue |
|              | Component of the cell membrane | Phospholipids  |
|              | For making lipid hormones      | Cholesterol    |

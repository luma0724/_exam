   - Glucose solution d1
   - Distilled water d1

4. *Test for starch*:

   - Spot plate q1
   - Dropper q3
   - Glucose solution d1
   - Distilled water d1

## Procedure

1. Prepare banana extract:
   1. Grind 2g of banana in 20 mL water with a mortar and pestle.
   2. Squeeze the ground materials through a muslin cloth and obtain the extract by filtration.

2. Use the banana extract to test for reducing sugar, glucose, starch.

### Test for Glucose

1. Dip the test end of the glucose test strip into the sample solution.

2. Observe the colour change.

| Contents         | Original colour of the glucose test strip | Colour of the glucose test strip after contact with the sample |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Glucose solution | Yellow                                    | Green                                                          |
| Distilled water  | Yellow                                    | Yellow                                                         |
| Banana extract   | Yellow                                    | Green                                                          |

### Benedict's Test

1. Add a drop of sample solution to 1mL Benedict's solution in the test tube.

2. Boil the mixture for 5 minutes.

3. Observe the colour change.

| Contents                               | Original colour of the mixture | Colour of the mixture after boiling/ other changes |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Glucose solution + Benedict's solution | Blue                           | Brick red precipitate                              |
| Distilled water + Benedict's solution  | Blue                           | Blue                                               |
| Banana extract + Benedict's solution   | Blue                           | Brick red precipitate                              |

### Test for Starch

1. Add a drop of sample solution to 1ml iodine solution in the spot plate.

2. Observe the colour change.

| Contents         | Original colour of the iodine solution | Colour of the iodine solution after adding a drop of sample solution |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Starch solution  | Reddish brown                          | Dark Blue                                                            |
| Distilled water  | Reddish brown                          | Reddish brown                                                        |
| Banana extract   | Reddish brown                          | Dark blue                                                            |

## Results

- Glucose, reduce sugars and starch are all present in banana.

- Limitation of food test?
  1. The food test can only give *qualitative or semi-qualitative results*, i.e., cannot show the exact amount of food substances in the sample. Only a rough estimation/ presence or absence of the substance is shown.

  2. The *original colour* of the food sample, esp. those with darker colour, may *mask the colour change* of food test for the food substances.

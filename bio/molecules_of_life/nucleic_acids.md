# Nucleic Acids

> **Organic substances**, **deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) & ribonucleic acids (RNA)** (*heredity* & *protein synthesis*, **double-helix structure**, *hydrogen bond*, *A-T, G-C*), **nucleotides** (**5-carbon sugar** (*deoxyribose & ribose*), **nitrogeneous group** (*adenine (A) & thymine (T), guanine (G), cytosine (C), uracil (U)*, *ATGC & AUGC*), **phosphate group**), **dinucleotides**, **polynucleotides** (*sugar-phosphate backbone*)

- **Organic substances**

- Two types of nucleic acids: **deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs)** and **ribonucleic acids (RNAs)**

- Constitution: *carbon (C)*, *hydrogen (H)*, *oxygen (O)*, *nitrogen (N)*, *phosphorus (P)*

- Functions: **heredity** and **protein synthesis**

- Basic units: **nucleotides**

## Nucleotides

- Structure:

  - A **5-carbon sugar**::**deoxyribose** in DNA and **ribose** in DNA

  - A **nitrogenous base**: e.g., **adenine (A)**, **thymine (T)**, **guanine (G)**, **cytosine (C)** and **uracil (U)**; **A, T, G, C** in DNA and **A, U, G, C** in RNA

  - A **phosphate group**

- **Dinucleotides**: formed by *condensation* of two nucleotides-*the phosphate group of one nucleotide and the 5-carbon sugar of the other nucleotide* (No water molecule!)

- **Polynucleotides**: a long chain of nucleotides maintained by the **sugar-phosphate backbone**

## RNA & DNA

- An RNA molecule consists of *a single polynucleotide chain*

- An DNA molecule consists of *two polynucleotide chains coiled around each other* to form a **double helix**; held by the **hydrogen bond** between the bases

- DNA -> same denaturation similar to proteins due to the hydrogen bond nature

- DNA *'pairing rule'*: 'A' with 'T', 'G' with 'C'

- Function difference: DNA -> carry genetic information for protein synthesis; RNA -> involved protein synthesis

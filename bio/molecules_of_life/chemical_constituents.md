# Chemical Constituents of Organisms

> **Biomolecules** (*carbohydrates*, *proteins*, *lipids*, *nucleic acids*), **inorganic** (*water*, *minerals*)

- Organisms are made up of different types of chemical substances:

  - **Biomolecules**::*large molecules found in organisms that contain carbon*

    - **Carbohydrates**

    - **Proteins**

    - **Lipids**

    - **Nucleic acids**

  - **Inorganic substances**:

    - **Water**

    - **Minerals**

- Major elemesnts: hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen + other trace elements e.g., phosphorus, magnesium, sulphur etc.

- Note that the proportion of different types of chemical substances varies among organisms

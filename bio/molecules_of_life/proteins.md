# Proteins

> **Amino acids** (*central carbon*, *amino group*, *carboxyl group*, *side chain (-R group)*), **dipeptides** (*condensation & hydrolysis*, **peptide bonds**), **polypeptides** (*hydrogen bonds*, *fold & coil*, *shapes & conformation & functions*, *denaturation & deamination*, *source of energy*, *structural materials*), *functional proteins* (*enzynmes*, *antibodies*, *haemoglobin*, *hormones*)

- *Diverse organic molecules*

- Composition: *carbon ($C$)*, *hydrogen ($H$)*, *oxygen ($O$)*, *nitrogen ($N$)*, *sulphur ($S$)* etc.

- Building blocks: **amino acids**

- Properties: **diversified functions**; **soluble in water**; *denaturation*

## Amino Acids

- Structure: consists of a *central carbon atom*, an **amino group ($-NH_2$)**, a **carboxyl group ($-COOH$)** and a **side chain (-R group)**

- Proteins are made up of *20 amino acids*; each differs in the side chain, i.e., the -R group defines the amino acid

- Can be classified into *non-essential* and *essential* amino acids depending on if it must be obtained from food

- Examples: e.g., glycine, alanine, isoleucine, methionine, cysteine etc.

- **Dipeptides** are formed by the **condensation of two amino acids**-*the amino group of one amino acid bonded to the carboxyl group of the other amino acid*(**peptide bond**)-with the *removal of a water molecule*

- Condensation & hydrolysis -> reversible

## Polypeptides and Proteins

- **Polypeptides** are chains of amino acids of *varying sequence and length*

1. *Hydrogen bonds* that forms among the amino acids cause the polypeptide chain to *coil and fold* into a variety of shapes

2. The coiled polypeptide chain may further fold up into a more *compact structure with a specific three-dimensional shape*

3. Multiple folded polypeptide chains may combine to form a *single protein molecule* of different *shapes (conformation)*, i.e., *different functions* served in organisms

- Note that the shape of a protein is solely maintained by the hydrogen bonds among the amino acid::broken by heat or changes in pH? proteins -> **denaturation**, i.e., losing its function

## Protein Functions

- **Structural components of cell membrane and cytoplasm** (for **growth and repair**)

- **Source of energy** when shortage of carbohydrates and lipids

- **Functional proteins**: e.g., *enzymes* (catalyse metabolic reactions); *hormones* (signals to cells); *antibodies* (to find germs); *haemoglobin* (to carry oxygen)

- Note that excess proteins would be broken down into amino acids as they cannot be stored, i.e., *deamination* (removal of the amino group)

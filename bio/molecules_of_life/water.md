# Water

> **Inorganic**, *abundancy*, *fluidity*, **solvents**, **medium** (*transportation & chemical reaction site*), **reactants** (*metabolic reaction*), **cooling agents** (*evaporation & sweating*), **temperature buffer** (*specific heat capacity*; *organisms & environment*), **support & movement aids** (*hydrostatic skeleton*, *buoyancy*, *turgidity*, *lubricant & friction*)

## Properties

- Chemical formula: $H_2O$

- Type of chemical substances: *inorganic* substance

- *Most abundant compounds in organisms*::*major component of cells, blood and other body fluids*

- Nature: no *energy value*

## Functions and Importance of Water in Organisms

### Good Solvent & Medium

- Property: *many substances dissolve in water* (hydrophilic & hydrophobic::)

- Functions: **solvent & medium** in which *chemical reactions* take place & *chemical substances transported through*

- Examples: e.g., *blood* is mainly made up of water; nutrients and waste e.g., oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported by blood around the body

### Good Reactant in Metabolic Reaction

- Examples: e.g., (catabolism::) water is a reactant in *hydrolysis* of large complex food molecules, e.g. maltose + water -> (maltase) glucose + glucose; (anabolism::) water is a reactant in *photosynthesis* with carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and food for plants

### Cooling Agent

- Property: *evaporation*

- Examples: e.g., *sweat* consists mainly of water; when water evaporates, it *takes away some heat* from the surface -> helps prevent *overheating*

### Temperature Buffer

- Property: *high specific heat capacity*, *most abundant in organisms*

- Examples: e.g., (organisms::) high proportion of water in body -> absorbs many heat before change in temperature -> *help remains fairly stable body temperature when there is change in environmental temperature*; (environment::) lakes and ocean -> relatively stable environmental tempeature -> *favorable habitat for aquatic organisms*

### Supporting Agent and Aids Movement

- Examples: e.g., (organisms::) *hydrostatic skeletons* e.g., earthworms and jellyfish; (cells::) plants cells being *turgid and rigid* due to the large center water vacuole; (plants::) water -> support to seedlings and non-woody plants; *buoyancy* for aquatic organisms; *lubricant* in body junction -> *reduce friction* and aids movement

### Effects of Dehydration

- Water -> lost when sweating and urinating

- Examples: e.g., headaches, fatigue, muscle cramps, headstroke, death if severly dehydrated

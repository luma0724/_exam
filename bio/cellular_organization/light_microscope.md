# Using a Light Microscope

- School laboratory microscopes: *compound microscopes* (light microscopes with compound lenses, i.e., *eye pieces* & *objectivesz*)

## Structure of a Light Microscope

- Components:
  1. *Eyepiece*: magnifying lens the eye looks through
  2. *Objectives*: magnifying lens closest to the specimen
  3. *Body tube*: connecting the eyepiece to the objectives
  4. *Nosepiece*: holding the objectives of different magnifications
  5. *Stage clip*: holding the slide in position
  6. *Stage*: the slide put here for observation
  7. *Coarse adjustment knob*: to raise or lower the body tube for rough focusing
  8. *Fine adjustment knob*: to bring the image into a sharper focus
  9. *Mirror/ light source*: to bring the light to the specimen
  10. *Iris diaphragm*: regulating the amount of light passing through the condensor
  11. *Condensor*: to concentrate the light onto the specimen
  12. *Arm & Base*

## Magnification

- The **total magnification** of a compound microscope = *product of the magnification of the eyepiece and the objective*

- A photomicrograph of a specimen can be interpreted with a given magnification (= size of specimen in the image divided by the actual size)

### SI Units of Length

- SI unit of length: metre (m)

- Derived units:
  1. *Milliimetres* (1mm = 1e-3m)
  2. *Micrometres* (1um = 1e-6m)
  3. *Narometres* (1nm = 1e-9m)

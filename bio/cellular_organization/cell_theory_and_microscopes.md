# Cell Theory

> **Cell theory** (*all organisms made up of one or more cells*, *cell being the smallest functioning unit of life*, *cells derived from preexisting cells*), *discovery of cell related to the development of microscopes*, **microscopes** (**light microscope**, **electron microscope** (*scanning electron microscope (SEM) (external structures)*, *transmission electron microscope (TEM) (internal structures)*), *false colour*, *dehydration and chemical treatment of specimens*

## Cells as the Basic Unit of Life

- Property: *smallest functioning unit of life*, i.e., organisms (sever characteristics of life::)

- All organisms: consists of one or more cells -> *cellular organisms*

- Two types of organisms (cellular organization::): **unicellular** organisms (e.g., amoeba) and **multicellular** organisms

## Discovery of Cells and the Cell Theory

- Discovery: (1660s British scientist *Robert Hooke* (1635 - 1703)): light microscope to examine slices of cork from the bark of a tree -> observation: the cork was made up of *many tiny boxex* (naming of *'cells'* from those of a honeycomb)

- First observed living cell (1670s Dutch scientist *Anton van Leeuwenhoek* (1632 - 1723): inspired by Hooke's work *Micrographia* -> make powerful lenses for observing cells::first to observe *microbes* in pound water and the plaque from his teeth, blood cells, sperm cells etc.

- Pioneers of the **cell theory** (1830s German scientists *Matthias Schleiden* (1804 - 1881) & *Theodor Schwann* (1810 - 1882) & later *Rudolf Virchow* (1821 - 1902): summarization  of the findings of a number of scientists

- **Cell theory**:
  1. All organisms are made up of *one or more cells*
  2. The cell is the *basic unit of life*, i.e., the smallest unit of life that can carry out all of the processes of life
  3. Cells *arise from prexisting cells*

- The *spontaneous generation theory is decredited* after the detailed examination of cells

- Importance: provide the basis for the study of organisms

## Microscope Technology

- Types of microscopes: **light microscope** & **electron microscope** (*transmission electron microscope (TEM)* & *scanning electron microscope (SEM)*)

### Light Microscope

- Mechanism: use of *compound lenses* to *refract & focus* light from specimen -> magnified 2D image

- Use: observing *living cells* and preserved cells; observing *biological processes in living cells*

### Transmission Electron Microscope

- Mechanism: pass an electron beam through a thinly sliced specimen and uses a magnetic field to focus the beam -> high-resolution images

- Use: revealing the detailed *internal structures* of a specimen

### Scanning Electron Microscope

- Mechanism: scan the surface of a 3D specimen with an electron beam -> high-resolution images

- Use: revealing the *external structures* of a specimen

### Microscopic Techniques

- *False colour*: electron microsopces only produce black-and-white images -> add colour with special computer software

- *Dehydration & chemical treatment* of specimens: limitation of electron microscope

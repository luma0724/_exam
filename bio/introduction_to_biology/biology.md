# Biology

- **Biology**, with the word derived from the Greek words *'biologo'*, is the **scientific study of organisms**. 

## Characteristics of Life

- Seven typical characteristics of living organisms: **nutrition**, **respiration**, **movement**, **excretion**, **sensitivity (irritability)**, **growth**, **reproduction**.

- **Nutrition**: organisms need food to survive, e.g., plants make their own food by photosynthesis, animals feed on others.
  
- **Respiration**: organisms break down food to make energy available for body activities, e.g., movement, growth and repair.

- **Movement**: e.g., animals move around to search for food, mates and habitats, plants, although anchored 

- **Excretion**: animals have to remove wastes produced by metabolism occuring in their bodies, e.g., animals excretes wastes in form of urine, sweat and exhaled gas, while some plant shed leaves and some trees excrete waste as resin.

- **Sensitivity (irritability)**: organisms can detect and respond to the changes in their environment, e.g., animals have sensory organs and muscular systems to detect and respond to light, sound, and movement, plants detect light and water, and grow towards these vital resources.

- **Growth**: organisms grow in size and complexity, e.g., trees can grow and expands hundreds of years.

- **Reproduction**: organisms produce offsprings for the continuity of species.

## Themes of Study

- Biological molecules and the chemical processes within living organisms -> Biochemistry, e.g., molecules of life, metabolism and enzymes etc.

- Cells as the basic unit of life -> Cytology, e.g., cellular organization, cell membranes etc.

- Body structures and organization of organisms and their functions -> Anatomy & Physiology, e.g., human physiology, coordination and movement in huamns etc.

- Pattern and mechanisms of inheritance -> Genetics, e.g., reproduction, biotechnology etc.

- Identification of and classification of organisms -> Taxonomy

- Iteractions among various organisms and their interactions with enviroment -> Ecology, e.g., ecosystem, photosynthesis and respiration etc.

- Mechanism of evolution -> Evolutionary biology, e.g., origins of life and evidence for evolution, mechanisms off evolution and speciation etc.

- Use of biologyical processes and systems to make useful products -> Biotechnology, e.g., medicines, GM etc.

## Significance of Biology

- Biological discoveries and inventions help improve our living standards.

- Studying biology helps us understanding the nature, develop a respect for life and environment and prepare for future education and career.

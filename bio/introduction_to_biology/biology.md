# Biology

> **science**, **organisms**, **characteristics of life** (*nutrition*, *respiration*, *movement*, *excretion*, *sensitivity*, *growth*, *respiration*)

- **Biology**, with the word derived from the Greek words *'biologo'*, is the **scientific study of organisms**.

## Characteristics of Life

- Seven typical characteristics of living organisms: **nutrition**, **respiration**, **movement**, **excretion**, **sensitivity (irritability)**, **growth**, **reproduction**.

- **Nutrition**: organisms need food to survive, e.g., plants make their own food by photosynthesis, animals feed on others.
  
- **Respiration**: organisms break down food to make energy available for body activities, e.g., movement, growth and repair.

- **Movement**: e.g., animals move around to search for food, mates and habitats, plants, although anchored

- **Excretion**: animals have to remove wastes produced by metabolism occuring in their bodies, e.g., animals excretes wastes in form of urine, sweat and exhaled gas, while some plant shed leaves and some trees excrete waste as resin.

- **Sensitivity (irritability)**: organisms can detect and respond to the changes in their environment, e.g., animals have sensory organs and muscular systems to detect and respond to light, sound, and movement, plants detect light and water, and grow towards these vital resources.

- **Growth**: organisms grow in size and complexity, e.g., trees can grow and expands hundreds of years.

- **Reproduction**: organisms produce offsprings for the continuity of species.

## Themes of Study

- Biological molecules and the chemical processes within living organisms -> Biochemistry, e.g., molecules of life, metabolism and enzymes etc.

- Cells as the basic unit of life -> Cytology, e.g., cellular organization, cell membranes etc.

- Body structures and organization of organisms and their functions -> Anatomy & Physiology, e.g., human physiology, coordination and movement in huamns etc.

- Pattern and mechanisms of inheritance -> Genetics, e.g., reproduction, biotechnology etc.

- Identification of and classification of organisms -> Taxonomy

- Iteractions among various organisms and their interactions with enviroment -> Ecology, e.g., ecosystem, photosynthesis and respiration etc.

- Mechanism of evolution -> Evolutionary biology, e.g., origins of life and evidence for evolution, mechanisms off evolution and speciation etc.

- Use of biologyical processes and systems to make useful products -> Biotechnology, e.g., medicines, GM etc.

## Significance of Biology

- Biological discoveries and inventions help improve our living standards:
  - e.g., greatly reduce the death rate due to infectious diseases with the invention of vaccines
  - e.g., **pasteurization**, a sterialization technique invented from the knowledge of microorganisms that it improves food safety

- Scientific advances promote technological development:
  - e.g., discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA from X-ray diffraction images -> genetic engineering, DNA fingerprinting, genetic testing, gene therapy etc.

- Helps us protect the environment:
  - e.g., microorganisms in sewage treatment helps break down organic matter -> reduce water pollution

- Studying biology helps us understanding the nature, develop a respect for life and environment and prepare for future education and career.

## Problems

1. Characteristics of life::Bird fleeding from a flower: B. nutrition, movement and sensitivity

2. Characteristics of life::matching:

   - Nutrition? B. obtaning nutrients from the environment

   - Respiration? A. breakdown of food to release energy

   - Reproduction? D. producing offspring

3. Characteristic of life:: & Investigation::hypothesis: plants watered with glucose solution will grow more quickly than those watered with distilled water; soaked 100 green beans in water for 2 days to allow germination; 20 seedlings of the same height to seperate into two groups; distilled water and glucose solution respectively:

   - Classification of independent, dependent or control variables:

     - Height of the seedlings after 1 week: dependent variable

     - Width of the seedlings after 1 week: dependent variable

     - Number of leaves of the seedlings after 1 week: dependent variable

     - Type of liquid used to water the seedlings: independent variable

     - Amount of liquid used to water the seedlings every day: control variable

     - Length of the 20 seedlings chosen for the experiment: control variable

     - Amount of sunlight received by the seedlings: control variable

   - Classification of experimental and control groups:

     - 10 seedlings watered with distilled water: control group

     - 10 seedlings watered with glucose solution: experimental group

4. Characteristics of Life::a girl smells the aroma of bread from a bakery? D. sensitivity

5. Characteristics of Life::Correct? D. growth is the increase in body mass of an organism

6. Characteristics of Life> Life cycle of a duck -> two characteristics of life? Reproduction: the duck lays an egg containing an embryo; growth: the embryo in the egg grows up and develop into a duckling

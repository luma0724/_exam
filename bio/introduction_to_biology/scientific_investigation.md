# Scientific Investigation

> **Scientific investigation**, **scientific method** (*asking questions*, *observation*, *experiments (hypothesis, prediction, test hyppothesis)*, *analysis (results and conclusion)*), **control experiment** (*experimental set-up*, *control set-up*, *independent variable*, *dependent variable*, *control variables*, *fair test*, *due to `<independent variable>` under investigation but nothing else*), *ethics (negative effects on subjects)*, *variations and minimizing individual differences*

## The Scientific Method

- The **scientific method** is the collection of processes toward investigation of a phenomenon, which involves **observation**, **asking questions** about natural events, **investigation** and **analysis**.

### Stages of a Scientific Method

1. Make observations:
   - scientists observe the world carefully
   - curious about any unexplained phenomena

2. Ask relevant questions:
   - scientists ask questions about the cause of phenomena

3. Propose a hypothesis and make a prediction:
   - scientists propose a **testable** explanation to the question based on prior knowledge
   - they predict what the result will be based on the hypothesis
   - a prediction follows that form '*if hypothesis, then prediction*'

4. Design and conduct experiments:
   - scientists conduct experiments to test the hypothesis
   - they record the result accurately for analysis
   - experiments should be repeated several times such that the same result is to obtained that it is **reliable**

5. Analyse data and draw a conclusion:
   - Data support the hypothesis -> The hypothesis is valid
   - Data do not support the hypothesis -> Revise or reject the hypothesis

- Note that there is no same set of sequences an investigation must follow. For example, the conclusion 'organisms are made of cells' is validified by numerous observations

### Control Experiments

- A **control experiment** involves an **experimental set-up** and a **control set-up**.

- The **independent variable** is the only variable that is changed between the two set-ups and under investigation.

- The **dependent variable** is the variable that is being measured and recorded and is changed according to the independent variable

- The **control variables** are the variables that may change the dependent variable and are keep constant to *ensure that the investigation is a fair test*

#### Francesco Redi's experiment on the generation of maggots

- Phenomenon: If a piece of meat is left unattended for days, maggots will appear on the meat.
- Scientist: Francesco Redi, Italian doctor
- Background: Theory of 'spontaneous generation' -> living things can spontaneously emerge from non-living things
- Prior knowledge: Relation between flies and unattended meat
- Observation: Always flies around unattended meat
- Hypothesis: Maggots are produced by flies around the meat
- If testable: Not allowing flies to reach unattended meat should prevent the generation of maggots
- Independent variable: Whether the meet jar is accessible to flies
- Dependent variable: Appearance of maggots on the meat
- Control variables: The size of jars, same type of meat used, the duration the meat is left unattended

#### Placebo Effects

1. Purpose of including a control group in a medical investigation? To ensure the effect of the treatment is *due to* the treatment *under investigation but not anything else*

2. Unethical::effectiveness of birth pills on humans? (Negative effects on the subjects?) Control groups would be given a placebo which has no contraceptive effect. Subjects in the control groups may get pregnant

3. Unethical::using animals in drug testing? Animals may suffer from testing

4. Cell::regarded as a living organism? Yes: all sever characteristics of life exhibited

#### Investigation using Living Organisms

- *Variations* exist among organisms even when they belong to the same species -> use a large sample size & repeat the investigations for several more times to *minimize the effect of individual differences*

## Problems

1. Investigation::Control set-up::investigating if yeast is necessary to make bread spongy (recipe: flour, water, yeast): C. mix flour and water to make a dough

2. Investigation::conditions for seed germination; seeds in test tubes, independent variable: cotton wool dry or wet; aim of investigation: C. to show that seed germination requires water

3. Investigation::ref to 2.; control variables? B. numbers and seeds used and availability of air

4. Characteristic of life:: & Investigation::hypothesis: plants watered with glucose solution will grow more quickly than those watered with distilled water; soaked 100 green beans in water for 2 days to allow germination; 20 seedlings of the same height to seperate into two groups; distilled water and glucose solution respectively:

   - Classification of independent, dependent or control variables?

     - Height of the seedlings after 1 week? dependent variable

     - Width of the seedlings after 1 week? dependent variable

     - Number of leaves of the seedlings after 1 week? dependent variable

     - Type of liquid used to water the seedlings? independent variable

     - Amount of liquid used to water the seedlings every day? control variable

     - Length of the 20 seedlings chosen for the experiment? control variable

     - Amount of sunlight received by the seedlings? control variable

   - Classification of experimental and control groups?

     - 10 seedlings watered with distilled water? control group

     - 10 seedlings watered with glucose solution? experimental group

5. Investigation::hypothesis: microbes found in decaying meterials came from microbes present in the air; experiment: swan-neck + meat broth + boiling + cooled to room temperature and left for a few weeks (the swan neck allows air but not microbes or dust to enter the flast); set-up 1: zipped -> no microbes fonud; set-up 2: neck broken off -> broth turned bad, microbes found;

   - Purpose of boiling the broth for a period of time? To ensure that the microbes presenting initially in the flasks are killed, i.e., the presence of microbes is due to whether it is exposed to air but nothing else.

   - Concolusion drawn from the results of set-up 1? Microbes do not exist in the broth spontaneously.

   - Purpose of set-up 2? To ensure that the fact that microbes are not presenting in the flask is due to the swan neck disallowing microbes to enter under investigation but nothing else.

   - Results support hypothesis? Yes. In Set-up 1 the swan neck allow air but not microbes to enter the flask. There is no microbes found in the broth. However, in Set-up 2, the swan neck is broken, i.e., the broth is exposed to air with microbes. The broth turns bad and microbes are found. Therefore, it is validated by the results that the microbes found in the broth are due to the microbes presenting in air.

6. Hypothesis and prediction::Rewrite and improbe answers:

   - Hypothesis: Does adding crushed egg shells promote the growth of tomato seedlings?? Adding crushed egg shells promote the growth of tomato seedlings

   - Prediction: Using crushed egg shells as fertilizer can promote the growth of tomato seedlings.? The tomato seedlings grow faster and higher in height than adding the egg shells as fertilizer (than the tomato seedlings without adding the egg shells).

7. Investigation::experiment for identifyin gthe cause of the disease beriberi: group 1: chickens with beriberi and healthy chickens kept together; fed with unpolished rise -> chickens with beriberi recovedred, others remainded healthy; group 2: healthy chicken injected with bacteria taken from chickens with beriberi; fed with unpolished rice -> all chickens remained healthy; group 3: healthy chickens; fed with polished rice -> all chickens developed beriberi; healthy chickens; fed with unpolished rice -> all chickens remained healthy;

   - Conclusion? Beriberi is most likely non-infectious and eating unpolished rice can prevent beriberi in healthy chickens

   - Testing with prisoners whether the same cause led to beriberi in humans; included in the experimental design to make a valid conclusion? The test should have been performed on healthy prisoners; the control variables should have included the sex, age and body mass of the prisoners; the prisoners chosen for the test should have been randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups

8. Prediction::hypothesis: eating oranges can speed up the recovery from a cold? C. people who eat an orange every day recover from colds in shorter time than people iwho do no eat oranges

9. Investigation::transmission of plague: cage 1 of rats: plague infected rats with fleas and healthy rats -> all died of plague; cage 2 of rats: plague infected rats without fleas and healthy rats -> only plague infected rats died and healthy rats lived:

   - Hypothesis? Plague is transmitted among rats by fleas.

   - Conclusion? Seperating the healthy rats from the plague infected rats with fleas can prevent the transmission of plague.

   - Finds not accepted by the scientific community at first; NOS? Science is socially and culturally embedded

10. Investigation::whether a sample of mud from the seabed contains any living organisms; air in -> solution to remove carbon dioxide (e.g., *sodium hydroxide*)-> solution to test for carbon dioxide -> deep sea mud -> solution to test for carbon dioxide -> air out:

    - Chemical used to test for the presence of carbon dioxide? hydrogencarbonate indicator [hydrogencarbonate indicator](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zxtcwmn/revision/3)

    - Carbon dioxide detected coming from the mud:

      - Two characteristics of life? Respiration, excretion.

      - Conlude that sea mud contained living organisms? No. It is unknown that if the carbon dioxidfe produced is due to the living organisms in the mud sample under investigation but some other reaction that produce carbon dioxide

    - Three other characteristics of life? Movement: tigers move around in the environment to hunt prey; reproduction: ducks lay eggs to produce little ducklings; excretion: humans excrete wastes in forms of exhaled air, sweat and urine

11. Investigation::observation: people who had caught cowpox never caught smallpow; question and prediction: inoculating people with liquid from cowpox blisters would immunize them against smallpox; experiment: inoculated a healthy eight-year-old boy with liquid taken for a cowpox blister -> developed cowpox and quickly recovered -> inoculated with smallpox -> found not catching the disease; result: developed a vaccine against smallpox.

    - Biology related to society? With the biological knowledge about the relationship between smallpox and cowpox, we can develop useful technology such as vaccines to benefit the society; biological inventions such as smallpox vaccines have saved many lifes in the society, helping to improve the living standard

12. Investigation::observation: shells of shellfish have become thinner over the years; hypothesis: high levels of carbon dioxide in the sea water to become more acidic and the water may dissolve the shells:

    - Calculation::percentage decrease of mass: oyster: 22.8%, limpet: 20.3%, cockle: 18.7%, mussel: 12.5%.

    - Lose least amount of mass? Mussel

    - Conclusion? Acidic solution dissolves the shells of shellfish

    - One way to improve the investigation? Test out the effect of acids of different acidity on different types of shells

# Taming the Sand

## Causes of Desertification - As to Tackle Them

- Note that the causes of desertification are *similar*. Lands that are at risk of desertification have *extensive drylands* surrounding with *increasing population pressure and agriculture*. (Human factors)

- Human disruption => Worsening desertification: e.g., misuse of water resources and fuel resources, over-agriculture etc.; As a result, the problem may be more severe in under-developed countries, e.g., Mali, due to its low level of education of her population

## Similarities and Differences in Measures - For Analysis

(Australia and the Sahel)

- Both *utilize education* to make their people more aware of the consequences of desertification and how to change their behavior to better sustain the productivity of their environments, e.g, *reduce/ adjust number of livestocks for grazing and choosing appropriate number of crops to grow*

- Both use measures to *prevent wind erosion*, e.g., **

# Taming the Sand

Keywords: **Restoration**, **management and monitoring and alert**, **education and farming practices**, **diversifying economy**, **sand stablization**, **legislation and law enforcement**, **population management**, **alternative energy sources**

(Case studies of China, Mali, Australia)

## Causes of Desertification - As to Tackle Them

- Note that the causes of desertification are *similar*. Lands that are at risk of desertification have *extensive drylands* surrounding with *increasing population pressure and agriculture*. (Human factors)

- Human disruption => Worsening desertification: e.g., misuse of water resources and fuel resources, over-agriculture etc.; As a result, the problem may be more severe in under-developed countries, e.g., Mali, due to its low level of education of her population

## Similarities and Differences in Measures - For Analysis

(Australia and the Sahel)

- Both *utilize education* to make their people more aware of the consequences of desertification and how to change their behavior to better sustain the productivity of their environments, e.g, *reduce/ adjust number of livestocks for grazing and choosing appropriate number of crops to grow*

- Both use measures to *prevent wind erosion*, e.g., *setting up of barriers to prevent wind erosion*

- Differences in measures due to the level of development: Australia has more money to invest and higher technology to tackle the problems => more controlable and effective, efficient; 

- As a result, Australia is more likely ot cope witht he problems as she has more resources to combat the problem head-on and other associated problems that results, e.g., food shortage

- Australia has more diverse economy and can develop industries that less likely lead to desertification; however, countries in the Sahel are more repliant on agriculture and cannot import food

## Measures!

- **Landscape recovery**: e.g., Planting trees for afforestration => prevent soil erosion and land degradation, d.t.: millions of hectares of trees to be planted, "Green Wall" in China; Also provide job employment

- **Sand stablization**: e.g., Sand barriers made of straws and grasses => Prevent wind => Prevent loosening of soil; In the other hand, decomposition of straws => increases the fertility of land; Stonelines in Sahal

- **Legislation and law enforcement**: e.g., 'Law of Environmental Protection', 'Law of Forestry', 'Law of Land Managment', banning traditional high-risk agricultural practises, e.g., overgrazing, misuse of fertilizers etc.

- **Management and Monitoring of Land**: Establish network of management and monitoring of lands with navigation satellites system, national information system, d.t., 'ACRIS' in Australia, alert system

- **Lower population pressure on the lands**: e.g., family planning, dynamic management of population, immigration etc.

- **Utilize alternatie resources**: e.g., utilize and implement renewable energy as to decrease the reliance on firewoods

- **Encourage other economic activities**: e.g., greenhouse agriculture, tourism => less demand on local agriculture => importing food

- **Natural restoration**: e.g., restore biodiversity by introducing native species on dry lands

- **Education**: e.g., organize local communities, promotion of more effective but less destructive and sustainable farming practises with lcoally adopted technology

- **Adaptable and low-cost farming practises**: e.g., multiple cropping, planting soil-demanding crops e.g. beans with soil-fertilizing crops e.g. millet, no tillage farming

# Taming the Sand

## Problem - Soil Erosion & Land Degradation

1. **Landscape recovery** (strengthen the soil): afforestation (slow down wind speed & rigidify the soil) in order to slow down soil erostion & land degradation; e.g., *'Green Wall'*, *'Three North Shelterbelt'*

2. **Sand stabalization** (fertilizing the soil & stabalizing the sand): e.g., straw checkerboards, natural decomposition of straws to increase fertility

3. **Using alternative energies**: e.g., reduce use of firewoods -> deforestation, use of solar cookers etc.

## Problem - Over-cultivation

1. **Management of argricultural and land resources** (decrease the size of farming activities): e.g., subsidies for returning cultivated land back into forest

2. **No tillage farming** (better farming techniques to attain soil fertility): cover farms with crop residue -> enhance soil fertility

## Problem - Over-grazing

1. **Bring back grassland artificially and reduce livestock grazing**

## Problem - Population Demand -> Over-cultivation/ Overgrazing

1. **Manage population growth/ immigrating residents from areas at risk of desertification**

2. **Encourage other economic activities**: e.g., greenhouse agriculture, tourism

## Problem - Lost of Biodiversity

1. **Restore native species**

## Legislation and Law Enforcement & Warning System (Precautionary Measures)

- Examples: National Drought Policy

## Education

- Educate farmers to perform effective techniques in farming, recovering landscapes and water conservation

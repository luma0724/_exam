ication and sandstorm**

## Desertification and Sandstorms

- **Desertification** is the process of **expansion** of arid and semi-arid areas causing **land degradation** in once productive land, occuring both short and long terms.

- e.g., Data: ~40% of the Earth's surface and 2 billion people are at risk of desertification, e.g., Africa, Middle East etc.

- Consequences of desertification:
  - Loss of vegetation
  - Water sources drying up,
  - Size of lake decreased; => No water for irrigation; No fish
  - No more human activities cann be practised

- Lands at risk of desertification: e.g., areas around the major arid and semi-arid areas around the world, e.g., lands around Sahel

- **Sandsotrms** are likely t4o occur *in or near deserts* with *plentiful of materials* that are affected by *strong winding*.

## Causes of Desertification and Deserts

### Physical Factors

(Taken Taklamakan Desert and Gobi Desert in China as examples)

- **Northern, northwest China** are most at risk of desertification as the area has annual rainfall *below 400mm* and existing deserts in the area, e.g., Talka Makan and Gobi Desert

- Still, **northern, northwest China** are most at risk of desertification as there is *plentiful supply of materials* and *strong wind in winter and spring*

- Note the relationship between desertification and sandstorms: **desertification is both a cause and an effect of sandstorms**:
    1. *Desertification*
    2. Soils is *dry and loose*
    3. Increases the *sources* of sand and dust
    4. Increase the *frequency and intensity* of sandstorms
    5. Speeds up *soil erosion* and *land degradation*, goto 1.

### Human Factors

1. **Population/Economy increase** => **Increase demand on resources**
2. **Removal of vegitation**:
    - *Over-cultivation*
    - *Deforestation*
    - *Overgrazing*
3. **Drier soil**:
   1. *Misuse of water resources*
   2. *Lower water table*
4. **More serious soil erosion**
5. **Land degradation**
6. **Desertification**

# Alternatives and Nuclear Energy

> *Pollution? Clearness?*, *environmentally friendly?*, *cost-effective?*, *space-effective?*, *geographical/ weather limitation?*, *energy-efficient?/ effective?*

## Nuclear Power

- Process of generating nuclear power: (heat -> steam -> generator -> electricity)
  1. *Uranium-235* undergoes **nuclear fission** in the nuclear reactor
  2. *Large amount of heat* given out due to the exothermic reaction
  3. The heat is used to boil water to steam
  4. The steam drives the generator to produce electricity

### Advantages of Nuclear Energy

1. *Extremely efficient*: a large amount of energy converted by a very small mass of uranium

2. *Larger reserves of uranium*: compared to fossil fuels, it is more stable and will not deplete soon like oil

3. *Reliable*: its production does not depend on weather conditions, geographical locations, or political influence etc.

4. *Reduce pollution*: no burning -> no air pollution/ greenhouse effect

### Disadvantages of Nuclear Energy

1. *Difficulty of disposal of radioactive wastes* -> need thousands of years for the radiation to deplete -> bury *underground*

2. *Threat of nuclear crisis*: e.g., *Fukushima Nuclear Crisis*

## Alternative

### Solar Energy

- Mechanism: capturing and converting the electromagnetic radiation from the sum to electricity

- Advantages: renewability, not limited to geographical locations, variety of application, clean, environmental friendly

- Disadvantages: limited by weather conditions, unstable energy output, expensive, not space-efficient

### Hydroelectric Power

- Mechanism: using the potential energy of falling water to push the turbines to generate electricity

- Advantages: renewable, controllable and predictable, efficient, clean

- Disadvantages: may not be environmental friendly to set up water reserviors, limited geographical locations, expensive

### Wind Energy

- Mechanism: wind power turbine to electricity

- Advantages: renewable, environmental friendly, clean

- Disadvantages: limited by both geographical locations and weather conditions, not space-efficient, expensive, cost-effectiveness of transportation

### Biofuel

- Mechanism: burning of any biological materials to generate electricity

- Advantages: cheap, renewable, stable and reliable and controllable

- Disadvantages: may not be environmentally friendly when harvested excessively, potential threat of destruction of ecosystem, not clean as cause air pollution, price dependent on food price, not cost-effective enough

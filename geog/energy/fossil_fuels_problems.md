# Problems with Fossil Fuels

> **Soil erosion & land degradation & lost of biodiversity**, **threat of water pollution by oil spill**, **water pollution due to oil transportation**, **global warming**, **acid rain**, **deforestation & desertification**

## Exploitation of Fossil Fuels

1. **Soil erosion & land degradation & Lost of biodiversity**:
   - *Opercast mining of coals* -> removal of vegetation & habitats -> *damage wildlife habitat & lost of biodiversity*

2. **Threat of water polution**:
   - *Oil spill* -> *threaten marine lifes & devastating long-lasting water pollution*
   - e.g., Explostion of Deepwater Horizon -> millions of barrels of oil spilled

## Transportation of Fossil Fuels

1. **Water pollution**:
   - *Sea transportation*: *oil leckage from supertanks*, esp. in areas along busy oil transport routes

## Use of Fossil Fuels

1. **Global warming**:
   - *Burning fossil fuels* -> greatly increases carbon dioxide emissions -> enhance *greenhouse effect* => global warming

2. **Acid rain**:
   - *Burning fossil fuels* -> e.g., sulphur dioxide & nitrogen oxides -> dissolve in rainwater and forms *acid rain* (pH < 5.6) => erosion of buildings & pollution of natural habitats

### Use of Fuel Woods in Less Developed Countries

- Advantages/ practical reasons for using fuel woods: *cheap, easy to obtain & use*

- Threat to health: burning of fuel woods produce a lot of smoke and ash that harms peoples' health

- Threat to environment: *deforestation & desertification*

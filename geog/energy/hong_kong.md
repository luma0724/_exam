# Sustainable Energy Consumption in Hong Kong

## Energy Consumption in Hong Kong

- Three main types of energy consumption: *electricity*, *gas* and *oil products*

- *Electricity*: commercial, industrial and residental

- *Gas (town gas & liquefied petroleum gas)*: *household cooking* & *LPG for minibuses & taxis*

- *Oil products (gasoline & diesel)*: transportation

### Problems with Energy Consumption Nowadays

- Mainly fossil fuel consumption -> air pollution

- *Increasing demand for energy consumption* -> *increasing population size & living standard*

### Dealing with Energy Problems

- Air pollution: *use of cleaner energy resources in electricity generation*: e.g., changing fuel mix, feed in tariff scheme, waste-to-energy

- Transportation: *use of cleaner fuels*: e.g., electric vehicles, hybird fuel vehicles, legislation for ocean going vessels

- Promote electricity conservation and efficiency: e.g., energy labelling scheme, energy efficiency buildings, education

- Increasing demand for energy resources: *use of more alternative energy resources than fossil fuels*, e.g., *renewable energy resources*

- Individual efforts

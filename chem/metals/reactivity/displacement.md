# Displacement Reactions of Metals

## Displacement Reaction

> **Displacement reaction** is a reaction in which *one element displaces another element from its compound*; in displacement reactions of metals, for two metals $M_1$ and $M_2$ with reactivities $R_1$ and $R_2$ respecively, if $R_1 > R_2$, $M_1$ will displace $M_2$ from the compound of $M_2$.

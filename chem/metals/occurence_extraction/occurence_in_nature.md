# Occurence of Metals in Nature

> **Free state**, **metal compounds** (*oxide & chloride & carbonate & sulphide*),**ores**, **metal ores** (*sufficient amounts*, *economical*)
> *Gold nugget*, *platinum nugget*, *bauxite (aluminium)*, *copper pyrite (copper)*, *haematite (iron)*, *galena (lead)*, *cinnabar (mercury)*

- Metals are the Earth can be found in form of both **free state** and **compounds**: e.g., *metal oxide, chlorides, carbonates, sulphides* etc.

- Note that little metals in the Earth's crust are found in free state, e.g., silver, gold, platinum etc., as they are extremely unreactive.

- Rocks which contain useful minerals are called **ores**; only the minerals that contain *sufficient amounts* to make it *economical* to extract the metals are called **metal ores**

- Examples: e.g.,
  - **Gold nugget**: gold occuring in free state in nature
  - **Platinum nugget**: platinum occuring in free state in nature
  - **Argentite**: main ore of *silver*; it contains mainly $Ag_2S$
  - **Bauxite**: main ore of *aluminium*; it contains mainly $Al_2O_3$
  - **Copper pyrite**: main ore of *copper*; it contains mainly $CuFeS_2$
  - **Haematite**: main ore of *iron*; it contains mainly $Fe_2O_3$
  - **Galena**: main ore of *lead*; it contains mainly $PbS$
  - **Cinnabar**: main ore of *mercury*; it contains mainly $HgS$
  - **Rock salt**: main ore of *sodium*; it contains mainly $NaCl$
  - **Zinc blende**: main ore of *zinc*; it contains mainly $ZnS$
  - **Magnesite**: main ore of *magnesium*; it contains mainly $MgCO_3$ etc.

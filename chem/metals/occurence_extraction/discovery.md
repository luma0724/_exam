# Discovery of Metals

- Human history is divided into four main different periods according to the *main types of materials used by humans*: **The Stone Age**, **The Copper Age**, **The Bronze Age**, **The Iron Age**

- The *more easily a metal can be extracted*, the *earlier it was discovered in history*

- The **availability** of a metal depends on:
  1. *Abundance* of the metal in the Earth's crust
  2. Ease and cost of *mining* the ore
  3. Ease and cost of *extracting* the metal

- The *less available* a metal is, the *more expensive* it is

# Uses and Properties of Metals

> General properties in favour: *low density but strong, cheap, hard, good conductor of electricity & heat, corrosion-resistant, biocompatible, malleable & ductile, shapable, attractive colour* etc.
> General uses: *construction, daily transporation, daily necessities* etc.

Common metals in daily life:

1. **Iron**:
   - Properties: hard, strong, malleable & ductile, cheap, very good conductor of electricity & heat, corrosion-resistant, strong, non-poisonous etc.
   - Uses: *constructions, ships and cars, electric wires, water pipes* etc.

2. **Aluminium**:
   - Properties: good conductor of electricity & heat, low density but strong, ductile & malleable, ductile, corrosion-resistant, non-poisonous etc.
   - Uses: *overhead power cables, aircraft bodies, kitchen foil, soft drink cans, window frames* etc.

3. **Titanium**:
   - Properties: low density but very strong, very corrosion-resistant, malleable, extremely high melting point, can be easily shaped, biocompatible (does not react with body fluids) etc.
   - Uses: *supersonic aircrafts, metal implants in human body* etc.

4. **Gold**:
   - Properties: attractive golden yellow colour, extremely corrosion-resistant, most malleable & ductile, soft etc.
   - Uses: *jewellery, coins* etc.

5. **Silver**:
   - Properties: attractive silver colour, corrosion resistant, malleable & ductile, moderately soft, best conductor of electricity etc.
   - Uses: *electrical and electronic components, jewellery, coins* etc.

## Problems

1. Uses of metals::suggest a metal which is suitable for each of the following purposes with explanation:
   - Making water pipes: iron; corrosion-resistant, non-poisonous
   - Making window frames: aluminium; low density but strong, ductile & malleable, corrosion-resistant etc.
   - Making thermometers: mercury; liquid state in room condition, high coefficient of expansion and contraction

2. Properties of metals::why is tungsten used for filaments in light bulb? extremely high melting point

# Reacting Masses

> One **mole (mol)** is the amount of a substance that contains *the same number of formula units as the number of atoms in exactly 12.0g of carbon-12 (Avogadro constant L ($mol^{-1}$))*, which is **6.02e23**
>
> One mol of substance has a mass *equal to its formula mass expressed in gram unit*; **molar mass** = *gram per mol ($g\ mol^{-1}$)*

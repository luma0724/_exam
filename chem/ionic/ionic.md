# Ionic

> **Ionic bonding**, *strong non-directional electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions*, **ionic bond**, *transfer of electron(s)*, **ionic compound**, *\electircally neutral*, *desribe the formation of ionic bonds by transfer of electrons between atoms*

## Ionic Bonding

> **Ionic bonding** is the **strong non-directional electrostatic attraction** between *oppositely charged ions*.
>
> An **ionic bond** forms by the **transfer of** one or more **electrons** from one atom (or a group of atoms) to another.
>
> An **ionic compound** is a compound which consists of ions. It is **electrically neutral**.

### Formation of Ionic Bond Between Sodium Chlorine

- A sodium atom $(2, 8, 1)$ *tends to lose one electron to attain the electronic arrangement of a neon atom $(2, 8)$* → Forms a sodium ion ($Na^+$)
- A chlorine atom $(2, 8, 7)$ *tends to gain one electron to attain the electronic arrangement of an argon atom $(2, 8, 8)$* → Forms a chlorine ion ($Cl^-$)
- When *a sodium atom reacts with a chlorine atom* → The sodium atom loses one electron to the chlorine atom, the sodium ion and chlorine ion held together by ionic bonding forming sodium chloride ($NaCl$)

### Formation of Ionic Bond Between Magnesium and Fluorine

- When *magnesium reacts with fluorine*, a magnesium atom *loses two electrons*, while a fluorine atom *gains one electron* → Each magnesium ion ($Mg^{2+}$) combines with two fluorine ions ($F^-$) to form magnesium fluoride ($MgF_2$)

### Formation of Ionic Bond Between Lithium and Oxygen

- When *lithium reacts with oxygen*, a lithium atom *loses one electron*, while an oxygen atom *gains two electrons* → Each lithium ion ($Li^+$) combines with two oxygen ions ($O^{2+}$) to form lithium oxide ($Li_2O$)

# Colours and Migration of Ions

> **Aqueous solution**, *coloured ions*, *gemstones*, **migration of ions**

## Colours of Ions

- The **aqueous solutions** of ionic compounds are *colourless* ⇒ The component ions are colourless
- The aquaeous solutions of ionic compounds containing the same component ion are *coloured* ⇒ The component ion is **coloured**
- Coloured ions: e.g., Aquaeous solutions of *iron(III) sulphate, iron(III) chloride and iron(III) nitrate are all pale green* → Iron(III) ion is pale green in colour

The colours of some common ions in aquaeous solution:

| Ion         | Copper(II)    | Iron(II)   | Iron(III)       | Cobalt(II) | Nickel(II) | Chromium(III) | Chromate     | Dichromate     | Manganese(II)  | Permanganate |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| **Formula** | $Cu^{2+}$     | $Cu^{3+}$  | $Fe^{3+}$       | $Co^{2+}$  | $Ni^{2+}$  | $Cr^{3+}$     | $CrO_4^{2-}$ | $Cr_2O_7^{2-}$ | $Mn^{2+}$      | $MnO_4^-$    |
| **Colour**  | Blue or green | Pale green | Yellow or brown | Pink       | Green      | Green         | Yellow       | Orange         | Very pale pink | Purple       |

## Coloured Ions in Gemstones

- *Colours of gemstones* → **Traces of coloured ions**

| Gemstone         | Amethyst           | Emerald           | Jade              | Peridot      | Topaz         | Turquoise      |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| **Colour**       | Purple             | Green             | Green             | Light green  | Yellow        | Bluish green   |
| **Coloured Ion** | Manganese(III) ion | Chromium(III) ion | Chromium(III) ion | Iron(II) ion | Iron(III) ion | Copper(II) ion |

## Migration of Ions

- When ionic compounds *are molten or are in aqueous solution* ⇒ They conduct electricity as the *ions in the compounds become mobile*
- *The migration of ions under the influence of electric field* ⇒ **Provides further evidencce that ions exist in some compounds**

### Migration of Ions under The Influence of An Electric Field

- General set-up:
  - Place a small *crystal* of the ionic cocmpound which at least one of its component ions is coloured (if no coloured ions → no observable change) in the middle of a piece of filter paper. The paper is placed on a microscope slide connected to a d.c. power suppply by electrodes and has been moistened with the aqueous solution of other compound which is colourless in colour in order to conduct electricity.
  - When a closed circuit is formed, a spot of the colour of the coloured ion moves slowly towards the electrode of electric charges opposite to that of the ion (respectively).

### Migration of Ions during Electrolysis Using a U-tube

- General set-up:
  - The bottom of the U-tube is filled with a *gel containing the ions* (same case and precautions as mentioned). After the electric current has passed for some time, colour(s) may gradually appears in the solution around the electrodes.

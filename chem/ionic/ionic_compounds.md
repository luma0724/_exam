# Names and Formulae of Ionic Compounds

> *Simplest ratio of numbers of component ions*, *balancing the charge*

## Names of Ionic Compounds

1. Refer to the names of the *component ions* in ionic compounds
2. The *cation is named first*, *followed by the anion*. Ommit the word “ion”

- Names of ionic compounds: e.g., Magnesium oxide ($MgO$), ammonium carbonate ($(NH_4)_2CO_3$), cobalt(II) permangate ($Cu(MnO_4)_2$), sodium hydrochlorite ($NaClO$), copper(II) phosphate ($Cu_3(PO_4)_2$) etc.

## Formulae of Ionic Compounds

- The formula of an ionic compounds → A symbol indicating the **type** and the **simplest ratio of numbers** of component ions in the compound

Constructing formulae of ionic compounds:

1. Write the *formulae of the two ions* side by side
2. *Take the number of charge on each ion across to the other*
3. Combine the symbols and *simplify the ratio*

### Formula of Sodium Oxide ($Na_2O$)

- For a sodium oxide compound ($Na_2O$) formed by *sodium ions  ($Na^+$) and oxide ions ($O^{2-}$)*, *two sodium ions are needed to balance the double negative charge of the oxide ion* ⇒ The formula of sodium oxide is $Na_2O$

### Formula of Magnesium Nitrate ($Mg(NO_3)_2$)

- For a magnesium nitrate compound ($Mg(NO_3)_2$) formed by *magnesium ions ($Mg^{2+}$) and nitrate ions ($NO_3^-$), two nitrate ions are needed to balance the double positive charge of the magnesium ion* ⇒ The formula of magnesium nitrate is $Mg(NO_3)_2$

### Formula of Ammonium Carbonate ($(NH_4)_2CO_3$)

- For an ammonium carbonate compound ($(NH_4)_2CO_3$) formed by *ammonium ions ($NH_4$) and carbonate ions ($CO_3$), two ammonium ions are needed to balance the double negative charge of the carbonate ion* ⇒ The formula of ammonium carbonate is $(NH_4)_2CO_3$

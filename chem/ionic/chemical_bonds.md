# Introducing Chemical Bonds

> **Conductor**, **electrolyte**, **non-conductor**, *conditional* **electrical properties**, **chemical bond**, **electrostatic attraction**, *chemical bonding â‡’ electrical properties*, **ionic bond**, **covalent bond**, **metallic bond**

## Investgating Electrical Conductivity of Substances

- Substances can be classified into **conductors**, **electrolytes** and **non-conductors** *in terms of electrical conductivity*

|                       | Conductors                                                   | Electrolytes                                                 | Non-conductors                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Electrical properties | Conduct electricity *in both solid and liquid states*, *without undergoing any chemical changes during conduction* | Conduct electricity *only when molten or in aqueous solution*, and *decomposed by electricity during conduction* | Do not conduct electricity                                   |
| Examples              | *All* metals: e.g., Copper, iron, mercury etc., and carbon (graphite) | Compounds *made up of metals and non-metals*: e.g., sodium chloride, copper(II) sulphate, lead(II) bromide etc., and *few compounds made up only of non-metals*: e.g., hydrogen chloride, ethanoic acid, citric acid etc. | All non-metals (except graphite): e.g., iodine, sulphur etc., and *most compounds made up of only non-metals*: e.g., distilled water, oil, methane, ethanol etc. |

## Chemical Bond

> A **chemical bond** is the **electrostatic attraction** (i.e., *attraction between opposite charges*) that holds particles together.

- The electrical conductivity of a substance is affected by the **chemical bonding** between particles inside these substances

### Types of Chemical Bonds

There are three main types of chemical bonds:

1. **Ionic bonds**: *Mainly* found in *compounds made up of metals and non-metals*
2. **Metallic bonds**: Foind *only in metals*
3. **Covalent bonds**: *Mainly* found in *non-metals and in compounds made up of only non-metals*

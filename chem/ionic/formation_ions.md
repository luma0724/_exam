Keywords: **Ion**, *derived from an atom or a molecule*, *net electrical charge (ionic charge)*, *attain the stable electronic arrangement of the nearest noble gas*, **cation**, **anoin**, **simple ion**, **polyatomic ion**

# Formation of Ions

> An **ion** is an atom or molecule with a net electrical charge.

- Atoms of elements other than noble gases *are usually unstable* → These atoms tends to gain or lose outermost shell electrons as to **attain the stable electronic arrangement of the nearest noble gas**
- An **simple ion** is produced when *an atom gains or loses electrons*

## Formation of Positive (Simple) Ions (Cations)

- A metal atom has *few outermost shell electrons (usually 1 - 3)* → Tends to **lose the outermost shell electrons** to form a **cation** (**positively charged ion**)

### Formation of Sodium Ions

- A sodium atom *has an electronic arrangement $(2, 8, 1)$* → Tends to lose one electron to attain the electronic arrangement of a stable neon atom $(2, 8)$ to form a sodium ion

- A sodium ion thus has *11 protons and 10 electrons* → It has an overall charge of +1

### Formation of Magnesium Ions

- A magnesium atom *has an electronic arrangement (2, 8, 2)* → Tends to lose two electrons to attain the electronic arragement of a stable neon atom $(2, 8)$ to form a magnesium ion
- A magnesium ion thus has *12 protons and 10 electrons* → It has an overall charge of +2

### Drawing Electron Diagrams to Represent Cations

1. Write the correct *atomic symbol*
2. Draw the correct number of *electrons and electron shell(s)*
3. Draw a square bracket
4. Write *the charge of the ion* on the top right-hard corner of the bracket:
   - Write ‘+’ if the overall charge is +1
   - Write “n+” if the overall charge n is larger than +1

## Formation of Negative (Simple) Ions (Anions)

- A non-metal atom has **more** *outermost shell electrons than a metal atom* → Tends to **gain outermost electron shells** to form a **anion** (**negatively charged ion**)

### Formation of Chloride Ions

- A chlorine atom *has an electronic arrangement ($2, 8, 7$)* → Tends to gain one electron to attain the electronic arrangement of a stable argon atom $(2, 8, 8)$ to form a chloride ion 
- A chlorine ion thus has *17 protons and 18 electrons*  → It has an overall charge of -1

### Formation of Oxide Ions

- An oxygen atom *has an electronic arrangement $(2, 6)$* → Tends to gain two electrons to attain the electronic arrangement of a stable neon atom $(2, 8)$ to form an oxide ion
- An oxide ion thus *has 8 protons and 10 electrons* → It has an overall charge of -2

### Drawing Electron Diagrams to Represent Anions

1. Write the correct *atomic symbol*
2. Draw the correct number of *electrons and electron shells*
3. Use ‘·’ and ‘x’ to indicate electrons from the atom itself and the other atoms(s) respectively commutably
4. Draw a square bracket
5. Just do what you should do. You know the rule, and so do I~

## Identifying Simple Ions and Polyatomic Ions

- Ions can be classified into **simple ions** and **polyatomic ions**

> A **simple ion** is derived from a single atom. A **polyatomic ions** is derived from a group of atoms.

# Classification of Matter

## Pure Substances and Mixtures

Matter can be classified into:

1. **Pure substances**
2. **Mixtures**

> A **mixture** consists of two or more pure substances which **have not chemically combined together**.

- e.g., Air is a *mixture of different gases*, e.g., nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide gases which are pure substances.

- Mixtures: e.g., Town gas, wine, stainless steel etc.

## Elements and Compounds

A pure substance can be classified into:

1. **Element**
2. **Compound**

### Elements

> An **element** is a pure substance that **cannot** be broken down into anything simpler by **chemical** methods.

- e.g., Water (formula: $H_2O$) *can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis*: water → (electricity) hydrogen + oxygen ⇒ Water is not an element; Hydrogen and oxygen *cannot be further broken down into anything simpler by chemical methods* → They are elements
- Elements: e.g., Mercury, sodium, chlorine, sulphur etc.

### Compounds

> A **compound** is a pure substance made up of two or more elements **chemically** combined together.

- e.g., Sodium chloride (formula: $NaCl$) is *made up of the elements sodium and chloride chemically combined together*: sodium + chloride → sodium chloride ⇒ Sodium chloride is a compound
- Compounds: e.g., Carbon dioxide, sucrose, slicon dioxide etc.

## Properties of Substances

- The properties of an substance can be classified into its **physical properties** and **chemical properties**

### Physical Properties

> The **physical properties** of a substance are those properties that can be determined without the substance changing into another substance.

- Physical properties: e.g., 
  - **Appearance** (colour and physical state)
  - **Odour**
  - **Taste**
  - **Hardness**
  - **Densitiy**
  - **Solubility** (in various solvents)
  - **Melting point**
  - **Boiling point**
  - **Malleability** (ability to be rolled into sheets)
  - **Ductility** (ability to be drawn into wires)
  - **Electrical conductivity**
  - **Thermal conductivity **etc.

### Chemical Properties

> The **chemical properties** of a substance are those properties that describe the ability of that substance to react with other substance(s) or to change from one substance to another.

- Chemical properties: e.g., Magnesium burns with oxygen vigorously *form magnesium oxide* ⇒ This is a chemical property of magnesium

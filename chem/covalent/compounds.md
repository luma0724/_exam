# Formulae and Names of Covalent Compounds

## Formulae of Covalent Compounds

Writing the formulae of covalent compounds:

> Order: **B > Si > C > P > N > H > S > I > Br > Cl > O > F**

1. Find the additional number of electrons each atom needs to attain the electronic arrangement of nearest noble gas
2. *Take the number of electrons required by each atom across to the other*
3. Combine and *simplify the ratio*

## Names of Covalent Compounds

- If a compond *only forms from two non-metal elements* → It should be named according to the following rules:
  1. The name of the second element should end up with a suffix **-ide**
  2. A prefix (**mono-**, **dy-**, **tri-**, **tetra-** etc.) is *usually used to indicate the number of atoms of that element in a molecule of the compound* (The prefix *‘mono’ is usually not added to the name of the first element in the molecule of the compound*)
- Names: e.g., Chlorine trifloride ($ClF_3$), Dinitrogen tetraoxide ($N_2O_4$) etc.
- Special names: e.g., Methane ($CH_4$), ammonia ($NH_3$), water ($H_2O$), hydrogen peroxide ($H_2O_2$) etc.

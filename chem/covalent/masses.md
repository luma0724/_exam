# Relative Molecular Mass and Formula Mass

- **Relative molecular mass** only applies to **molecular substances**
- **Formula mass** applies to all substances (or species) with a formula

## Relative Molecular Mass

> The **relative molecular mass** or **molecular mass** for elements and compounds *consisting of molecules*, it is the mass of one molecule of it on the  $^{12}C = 12.00$ scale, i.e., *sum of relative atomic masses of all atoms present in a molecule of the element or compound*.

- Relative atomic mass carries **no unit**

- e.g., The relative molecular mass of a water molecule ($H_2O$) = $1.0 \times 2 + 16.0 = 18.0$

## Formula Mass

> The **formula mass** of a substance (or species) is the mass of one **formula unit** of it on the $^{12}C = 12.00$ scale, i.e, *sum of relative atomic masses of all atoms present in a formula unit of the substance (or species)* .

- e.g., The formula mass of a magnesium chloride compound ($MgCl$) = $24.3 + 35.5 \times 2 = 95.3$

# Dative Covalent Bond

> A **dative covalent bond** (or **coordinate bond**) is a covalent bond formed between two atoms where both electrons of the bond pair are contributed by the same atom.

- Atoms which *have lone pairs of electrons* → May form **dative covalent bond**
- In structural formula, the symbol ‘→ ’ is used to represent the dative covalent bond
- Once a dative covalent bond has formed, dative and normal covalent bonds in the ion are **identical**

## Dative Covalent Bond in Ammonium Ion ($NH_4^+$)

- When an *ammonia molecule ($NH_3$) combines with a hydrogen ion ($H^+$) to form an ammonium ion* → A dative colvalent bond forms between the two lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom ($N$) in the ammonia molecule and the hydrogen ion

- The ammonium ion ($NH_4^+$) has *an overall charge of +1 distributed all over the structure*
- When an ammonium ion reacts with a chloride ion, *the ammonium ion loses one outermost shell electron to the chloride ion to form ammonium chloride ($NH_4Cl$) as a result of transfer of electron* → It contains both **ionic bonds** (between $NH_4^+$ and $Cl^-$) and **covalend bonds** (4 $N - H$ bonds, while one is a dative covalent bond)

## Dative Covalent Bond in Hydronium Ion ($H_3O^+$)

- When *hydrogen chloride gas ($HCl$) is passed into water ($H_2O$), hydrogen chloride molecules break down to give hydrogen ions ($H^+$) and chloride ions ($Cl^-$)*  → Each *water molecule comnbines with a hydrogen ion to form an* **hydroxonium ion** *or* **hydronium ion** *($H_3O^+$)* → A dative covalent bond forms between the lone pair electrons on the oxygen atom ($O$) in the water molecule and the hydrogen ion

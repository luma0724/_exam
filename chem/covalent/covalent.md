# Covalent

## Covalent Bonding

> **Covalent bond** is the **strong directional electrostatic attraction** between the *shared electrons and the two nuclei of the bonded atoms*.

> A **covalent bond** forms by *sharing outermost shell electrons* between two atoms.

- A **bond pair of electrons** (a **bond pair**): A pair of electrons shared between the two atoms
- A **lone pair of electrons** (a **lone pair**): A pair of outermost electrons that is not shared between the two atoms

### Molecular Formula And Structural Formula

> The **molecular formula of a molecular substance is the formula which shows the **actual number of each kind of atoms** in one molecular of the substance.

- e.g., $Cl_2$, $O_2$, $CO_2$ etc.

> The **structural formula** of a molecular substance is the formula which shows **how the constituent atoms are joined up** in one molecule of the substance.

- e.g., $Cl - Cl$ , $O = O$, $N \equiv N$ etc.

### Covalent Bonding in Non-metal Elements

#### Formation of Covalent Bond in a Chlorine Molecule ($Cl_2$) (Single Covalent Bond) 

- The outermost shell of chlorine atom contains only 7 electrons, i.e., *one electron less than an octet* → It needs to gain one electron to get the electronic arrangement of a stable argon atom $(2, 8, 8)$
- Each chlorine atom *shares an outermost electron* with another chlorine atom → Form a **single covalent bond**
- Therefore, a chlorine molecule consists of 2 chlorine atoms, in which each chlorine atom has a **stable octet**.

#### Formation of Covalent Bond in an Oxygen Molecule ($O_2$) (Double Covalent Bond)

- An oxygen atom has 6 outermost electrons, i.e., *two electrons less than an octet* → It needs to gain two electrons to get the elctronic arrangement of a stable neon atom $(2, 8)$
- Each oxygen atom *shares two outermost electrons* with another oxygen atom → Form a **double covalent bond**
- Therefore, an oxygen molecule consists of 2 oxygen atoms, in which each oxygen atom has a **stable octet**.

#### Formation of Covalent Bond in an Nitrogen Molecule ($N_2$) (Triple Covalent Bond)

- A nitrogen molecule has 5 outermost electrons, i.e., *three electrons less than an octet* → It needs to gain three electrons to get the electronic arrangement of a stable neon atom $(2, 8)$
- Each nitrogen atom *shares three outermost electrons* with another nitrogen atom → Form a **triple covalent bond**
- Therefore, an nitrogen molecule consists of 2 nitrogen atoms, in which each nitrogen atom has a **stable octet**.

### Covalent Bonding in Covalent Compounds

> A **covalent compound** is a compound which consists of atoms chemically combined together by covalent bonds.

- Covalent compounds: e.g., Hydrogen chloride (m. formula: $HCl$, s. formula: $H - Cl$⇒: To get a stable electronic arrangement, *one electron from a hydrogen atom and one electron from a chlorine atom are shared* → Form a **single covalent bond**.

- Molecules of covalent compounds: e.g., Water ($H_2O$), ammonia ($NH_3$), methane ($CH_4$), tetrachloromethane ($CCl_4$), carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) etc.

### Number of Electrons Contributed to Sharing

- The number of electrons an atom contributes to sharing = **The additional number of electrons needed** to get the electronic arrangement of the nearest noble gas

# Molecules and Atomicity

## Molecules

> A **molecule** is the smallest part of an element or a compound which can exist on its own under room conditions.

- Electric charge: **Neutral**
- Constitution: **Atoms of one or different kinds**

### Molecules in Compounds

- Compounds made up of *only non-metals* → Usually consist of **molecules**
- e.g., Water consists of water molecules (formula: $H_2O$), which each consists of two hydrogen atoms and a oxygen atom chemically combined together
- Molecules of compounds, e.g., carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), ammonia ($NH_3$), hydrogen chloride ($HCl$) etc.

### Molecules in Elements

- Elements consist of *either atoms or molecules*:
  - *All metals* consist of atoms
  - *Most non-metals* consist of **discrete molecules**
- e.g., Chlorine consists of discrete chlorine molecules (formula: $Cl_2$), which each consists of two chlorine atoms chemically combined together

- A *molecule of an element* → consists of **atoms of the same kind**
- e.g., A chlorine molecule consists of chlorine atoms only; a sulphur molecule consists of sulphur atoms only etc.

## Atomicity

> **Atomicity** is the number of atoms in a molecule.

1. **Monoatomic**
2. **Diatomic**
3. **Triatomic**

Atomicity of molecules of some elements:

| Element                       | Formula | Atomicity      |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Argon                         | $Ar$    | 1 (Monoatomic) |
| Hydrogen                      | $H_2$   | 2 (Diatomic)   |
| Chlorine                      | $Cl_2$  | 2 (Diatomic)   |
| Oxygen                        | $O_2$   | 2 (Diatomic)   |
| Nitrogen                      | $N_2$   | 2 (Diatomic)   |
| Oxygen (Ozone)                | $O_3$   | 3 (Triatomic)  |
| Phosphorus (White phosphorus) | $P_4$   | 4              |
| Sulphur                       | $S_8$   | 8              |
